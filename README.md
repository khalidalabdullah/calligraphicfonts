# Making Arabic Calligraphic Fonts

You can find here the exercise files related to the video tutorials on making Arabic calligraphic fonts. The files are FontCreator project files. For each tutorial I am including a start and finish file. Those who are interested in following the tutorials can try out the exercises using the start files and comparing their work with the results in the finish files.
